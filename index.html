        <h1>My IMT Experiences</h1>
        <p class="intro">
            Being a part of the Telecommunication Student Association/IMT "Signum" ITB has been a journey of growth, laughter, and unforgettable moments. Here are some of the highlights:

                <h3>Spektrum 2023: The Beginning</h3>
                <p>
                    Joining IMT was no walk in the park. Spektrum 2023 was a whirlwind of ups and downs, packed with fun yet sometimes grueling activities that tested our resilience. But through it all, we overcame the challenges together and earned our place in IMT.

                <h3>Publication and Documentation Division in Wisokto 2023</h3>
                <p>
                    Serving in the Publication and Documentation Division for Wisokto 2023 was an adventure in itself. I unexpectedly found myself as a part-time actor‚Äîdefinitely out of my comfort zone, but a hilarious and rewarding experience. Beyond acting, I delved deeper into photography and filming, honing skills that have become invaluable in capturing stories and memories.

                <h3>Watching Wisokto: A Moment of Inspiration</h3>
                <p>
                    Being an staff member at Wisokto was a humbling experience. Watching alumni share their beautiful and inspiring stories as they graduated left a profound impact on me. Their words were a reminder of how meaningful and transformative this journey in IMT can be.

                <h3>Becoming a Mentor in Spektrum 2024</h3>
                <p>
                    Returning to Spektrum, but this time as a mentor, was a heartwarming experience. Watching our juniors grow, learn, and embrace the IMT spirit brought back memories of my own beginnings in Spektrum 2023. It was nostalgic and fulfilling to connect with them, guide them in studies and IMT traditions, and share the fun and camaraderie that makes this community so special.
